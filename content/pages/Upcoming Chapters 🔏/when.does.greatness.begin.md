### When does greatness begin? 

Professionally I would like to pursue a more in-depth understanding of technologies that helps me communicate with others around me. Between my undergraduate study and professional career, I tried to maintain a level of knowledge for the task at hand.


## My First Bachelor

My first degree was in Visual Communications (Graphics Design). I chose the creative route because I was able to solve the problems visually. Web design and development provided a level of creative development that I preferred. Encapsulating logical patterns with code and artistic expression with animation, styling built on top of HTML, CSS, and Javascript helped with creating the building blocks for learning. The innovative technology was not famous for finding employment in Suffolk County NewYork, so I tabled these ideas and tried to pursue something that would pay the bills but would not remove the idea of working in the Internet Engineering space.

## The Evolution of the Web.


Shortly after my graduation in 2005, web Technologies have evolved beyond what I could have imagined. I want to learn to hone these skills to teach others in the form of game-based learning elements. There is a substantial amount of research that can be a reference in producing games for more than just entertainment. Combining machine learning, natural language processing, custom game-modding, VR/AR as well as online instruction, you can engage students better than with traditional methods.

An advanced degree in Technology System Management could provide me with a way to continue to build upon the concepts I learned during my undergraduate at Stony Brook University. The multi-discipline approach to solving problems will come in handy in trying to do research and create a product that can help me express my ideas of using games to learn.

## Technology and Society


From the standpoint of being an expert in this field, I am but a consumer of products such areas can create. (Computers, smartphones, smart watches, the English language, the Japanese language and Society ) I enjoy playing video games and in searching for more productive ways to learn new skills. As technology continues to improve across the board, I am always excited to find ways to use such technology to keep me motivated.

With this degree, I would be able to take graduate courses that will build the foundation for learning topics like computational social science, computer vision, computer science and engineering and game design to create a unique approach for solving real-world issues. Issues that I am interested in are helping others achieve their own goals by liberating them within the boundaries of their minds. To inspire the family and friends around me to attempt their own goals whether they are publicly or privately known.

I also want to do this to test my limitations. Using social media to document my journey for all to see and to find some use that could help others who can not afford to go to school or have the desire for structural learning. 

I would like to note that learning does not just take place in academia it is all around us. I believe that I have found a way to pursue higher education without the sacrifice of what is important around me (family, public contributions, and friends)


## Reflections of my college years....

During my college years, I worked at several facilities that provided health services or direct care services. This type of care was common on Long Island, especially for students like myself. The hours were flexible, and the workload did not change much. I considered even to pursue a degree in Nursing.

That all changed when I became quite good at reading and writing in Japanese. Becoming proficient in Japanese came from the years of playing a game online with other Japanese people for the sake of playing it. I was able to reprogram my mind to do something I couldn't do before.

I took my new theory and began to start building out websites and submitting code to open source repositories like github . I realize that if I continue to work on trying new things rejecting the theories that did not work and keeping the ones that did I could improve. 

These very ideas did not originate from me alone. Some stem from my Parents, others from my  Professors,  most from the many authors I have read in my life. The feeling that I am progressing one step at a time towards the direction I would like to be always moving, together.
