## Creating Podcasts to make more content.

Podcasting was a way for me to focus on staying focus with the information I needed to consume in order to become more experience with what I wanted to become. 

Technology and Society has a lot to do with how I look at my life and the environment my life resides in. Each week I choose a theme and provided either a person to interview about that theme, a book that I read about that theme, or a challenge within my life that I felt this particular theme would help me overcome such a challenge.

### Here are the podcast links and some of the episode I think you would like to learn more about.

### How you should listen to my podcasts.

My podcasts are about learning a topic in a research manner. I am not the expert on these topics but I am a curious about them tremendously. In order to become an expert on these topics I feel I need to read up on them and take courses on these topics. I should also create content and projects that helps me test my theories on such topics. The perk about podcasting is that it helps me keep myself accountable and allows my work and talks to be easily obtainable in the archives of the web.
