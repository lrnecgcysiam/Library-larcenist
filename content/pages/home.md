### This is me at 7 years old (left) and me at Stony Brook University (right)

These pictures of me express two points in my life where I feel like my image of myself was pretty close aligned. At 7 years old my mom took this picture me singing and dancing while she was getting me ready for church. The other picture is me at Stony Brook University while my friends was playing with the camera taking pictures on a nice day. 

Both Pictures were times I had big dreams for myself and I pledge to my younger self to not let him down. The 7 year old me would have never just settled for anything just because he was afraid of what people thought. 

Writing a book about my life is exciting and I am very excited to have the energy to put it together. I am looking put it together anyway I can and perhaps put it together properly with others whom are interested in reading my work and trying to help me truly connect with myself and others I truly care about.
