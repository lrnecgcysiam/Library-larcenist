### This is me at 7 years old (left) and me at Stony Brook University (right)

These pictures of me express two points in my life where I feel like my self image was pretty closely aligned.  Around 7 years old my mom took this picture of me singing and dancing while she was getting me ready for church. The other picture is of me at Stony Brook University while my friends were playing with the camera taking pictures on a nice day. 

Both Pictures were times I had big dreams for myself and I pledge to my younger self to not let him down. The 7-year-old me would have never just settled for anything just because he was afraid of what people thought. 

Writing a book about my life is exciting and I am very excited to have the energy to put it together. I am looking to put it together any way I can and perhaps put it together properly with others who are interested in reading my work and trying to help me truly connect with myself and others I truly care about.
