I believed for a long time my life's work would be in computers in some sort of fashion. That I would contribute in some shape or form for the social good of our 
world helping to narrow the digital divide. The idea of the digital divide was not clear until recently because I was still inside the huge gap. Looking for ways to work with computers was very difficult when I spoke with people in school. 

One of my Math Teacher's in High School stated that in order to get a computer science degree that I had to take a lot of math courses this didn't deter me as much but I would have hoped for advice at getting closer to that dream. Building the path for your dream I finally realized only can come from a person that has done it themselves.

So trying to get advice from others I realized I have to remember who I was and what I always really wanted. That was the most challenging. I began to see how ugly people around you can become when they see you willing to do what they couldn't or were too afraid to do for whatever the reason was.

The early years of my life (pre-Y2 K) went along very similar to something like that. I wasn't able to go straight to college and take computer science I had to take community college courses then change my major and try various paths while trying to keep the world around me the way it always was.

This was really exhausting but I finally realized that it was all worth it. Being able to reflect on my mistakes and experiences I was able to make better decisions for myself. The decision I have today to make this book first using a static site generator with 11ty was because of those experiences.
