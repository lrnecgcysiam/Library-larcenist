### Heading out to Stony Brook Adaptive Aquatics Ceremony 2007

Working at UCP I was privileged to help people participants like John here attend the Stony Brook University Adaptive Aquatics sessions twice a week. I and the other staff member took turns helping John participate with the public. It was one of the most exciting times for John. At the end of each semester, the program hosted a ceremony to hand out awards and celebrate with everyone who was a part of the program.
