### Heading out to Stony Brook Adaptive Aquatics Ceremony 2007

Working at UCP I was privileged to help people participants like John here attend the Stony Brook University Adaptive Aquatics sessions twice a week. I and the other staff member took turns helping John participate with the public. It was one of the most exciting times for John. At the end of each semester, the program hosted a ceremony to hand out awards and celebrate with everyone who was a part of the program.


The Adaptive Aquatics is a program that uses water as a medium for the rehabilitation of a great variety of muscular, neuromuscular and neurological problems. The sessions required John to improve his range of motion and strength and he really enjoyed being with his instructors. The session was held at the Stony Brook University Pool at night.

## Working with people with disabilities full time in Suffolk County


Long Island was pretty popular for housing individuals with disabilities the jobs that were available were normally providing direct care to these individuals in a group home setting. I worked in this field from 2001  to 2015 at various different locations and organizations. I will update my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cksamuel/) with more detailed information about the organizations I worked at but it was been well over a decade since I have worked at such places.

One of the popular Job titles was Direct Care Support Specialist, another one was Month health Therapy Aide. As an aide you would provide support to the program's participants with washing, feeding, dressing, administering medication and teaching during the duration of your shift. You also were required to attend any social event they had scheduled. John was one of my favourite people to work with. He loved wrestling and Baseball and although he had a difficult speaking you learned how to understand him without him being able to fully speak.
