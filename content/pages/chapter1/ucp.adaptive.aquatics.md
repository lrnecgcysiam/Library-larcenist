### Heading out to Stony Brook Adaptive Aquatics Ceremony 2007

Working at UCP I was privileged to help people participants like John here attend the Stony Brook University Adaptive Aquatics sessions twice a week. I and the other staff member took turns helping John participate with the public. It was one of the most exciting times for John. At the end of each semester, the program hosted a ceremony to hand out awards and celebrate with everyone who was a part of the program.

The Adaptive Aquatics is a program that uses water as a medium for the rehabilitation of a great variety of muscular, neuromuscular and neurological problems. The sessions required John to improve his range of motion and strength and he really enjoyed being with his instructors. The session was held at the Stony Brook University Pool at night.
