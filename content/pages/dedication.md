## Dedication
### To my Uncle "Ike" Isaac Ellis...


This book will be dedicated to my late Uncle Isaac Ellis. His passion for computers and programming influenced my path toward computing greatly. His passion also allowed him to overcome a great deal of problems in his own life and with that led to him being able to give me and my siblings our first Macintosh the Apple IIe. This led my parents investing in many more computers from Apple until I was able to buy my very own.
