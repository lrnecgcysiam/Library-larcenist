### Traveling to Japan for the first time.

Since I was young I have always been fascinated with the opportunity to travel to Japan. 
Japan has had a large influence on me and I am very excited to finally sit down and write about my thoughts about being in Japan. I finally was able to visit Japan on 1/10/2009 where I travelled alone for 10 days. 

The idea of going to Japan alone was always scary cause I was constantly thinking of the worst. What if I run out of money? what if I lose my passport? Who would I talk to if I had not visited the hospital? All these things ran through my mind during the 2 months of preparation for this trip. 

I will have to admit that this trip was influenced by another trip to Germany with a Friend and I was going to a country where I had family and friends living so it was not as scary. That first trip to Germany did help me make the decision to go to 
Japan since I realized that it wouldn't cost as much as I thought it would have.


### How much was the cost of going to Japan the first time?

When I was in high school I thought Japan was going to be expensive because of the cost of hotels I saw online. 150 -200 dollars a night (USD) I didn't have any friends at the time in Japan so I was all on my own. In 2008 though I have been using the internet to learn about Japan. Such as podcasts from ex-pats, English teachers, and language schools.  The internet made the world we live in much smaller and I was able to follow along with other people living in Japan outside the video confines of Larger media circles. There was also the interest in using Hostels which was much more affordable than a traditional hotel.

For 10 days I paid about 1200 dollars for a round trip ticket and an additional 2000 dollars for lodging, food and transportation. I did not have many expenses at home and I did not have to use many credit cards as a lifeline. I was going to visit a friend I made in New York during an English Teaching Interview session. He was accepted into the program and was stationed on the island of Shikoku（四国）in a city called Kochi（高知）。

### Traveling through Japan and the JR Rail Pass.

Getting there from Tokyo was about 7-8 hours via the super high-speed railway. Japan provided a deal for tourists visiting Japan to ride any Japan Railway train for a bundled fee ($150-$400). The Japan Trip because of a reward for me for all my hard work during the year. Between work and school taking a vacation during the winter and summer was so satisfying. I also was able to improve my Japanese speaking and listening skills by practising throughout the year and on the trip themselves. I highly recommend everyone who can visit a country that does not speak your native tongue. This type of exposure is an experience that I can not explain enough. Since the language is not my native tongue being easily distracted by people speaking to you or hearing unfamiliar sounds in my surroundings is relaxing and you can turn to choose what to focus listening to. This is also can become a problem because my patience to listen to someone in Japanese can fade after so long.
