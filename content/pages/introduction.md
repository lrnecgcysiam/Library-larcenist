## This is a big deal.

This book is dedicated to helping people I know and want to do business with learn more about my thoughts and ideas and why I came up with writing a book to help people get an idea on how i look at myself.

### What will be in this book?

I have been thinking about this alot and I decided to create a time line between 2001-2021 a book on the last twenty years of my life. I have been able to keep alot of information on my life since I finished high school and with that I can share photos, videos and music from that time. This website book will be able to help me share content from other sites to help build more visual representations of what I am trying to write about. 

### Chapters should be divided into years?
 
I would like to have each chapter places into years or segments but ties everything together nicely?

- 2001
- 2002
- 2003
- 2004
- 2005
- 2006
- 2007
- 2008
- 2009
- 2010
- 2011
- 2012
- 2013
- 2014
- 2015
- 2016
- 2017
- 2018
- 2019
- 2020
- 2021

    I think think list is a great way organize topics that I wish to talk about without them being in an particule order other than time.
